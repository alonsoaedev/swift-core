/*
 The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, 
 university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember.
 Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

 1. If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
 2. If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
 3. If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
 4. Otherwise, just print the number.

for number in 1...100 {
    if number.isMultiple(of: 3) && number.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("FizzBuzz")
    } else if number.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        print("Fizz")
    } else if number.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("Buzz")
    } else {
        print(number)
    }
}
